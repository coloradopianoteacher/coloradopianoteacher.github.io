  <p class="header" id="q1">When should my child start taking piano lessons?</p>
  <p>It depends.  I teach children as young as 5 years old.  Starting at this young of an age, though, can be frustrating for the student since their biggest challenge will be mastering the hand-eye coordination required to play the piano.  Some parents choose to wait until the child is 6 or 7 years old in order to avoid the issue altogether.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q2">Is it possible to schedule a Meet & Greet before committing to our first lesson?</p>
  <p>Absolutely!  In fact, children especially seem to really enjoy these since it takes away some of the anxiety that can come along with the first lesson.  Meet & Greets last about 20 minutes and allow me to show you the books that I teach from, and share a little bit about myself. I also like to teach students a simple duet on the piano that we will play together before you leave.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q3">I have more than one child.  Is it possible to schedule their lessons back to back on the same day?</p>
  <p>I will make every effort to accomodate both your scheduling and transportation needs.  My schedule does fill up, however, so the sooner you are able to schedule your lessons, the better.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q4">Can I sit in on any of my child's lessons?</p>
  <p>Of course!  You may sit in on every one if you'd like.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q5">My child already started taking lessons at another piano studio.  Do I have to buy all new books before starting at yours?</p>
  <p>Typically not.  If this is the case with your child, I do prefer that we schedule a Meet & Greet so that I know what I will be teaching from before the first lesson.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q6">What tips can you offer to help motivate my child to practice?</p>
  <p>I've found that the best technique is to use a <a href="practice.html">practice chart</a>.  The chart allows the child to set goals for each week, and provides a sense of accomplishment when he/she meets those goals.</p>
  
  <p class="header" id="q7">I saw on your biography page that you are a member of the National Guild of Piano Teachers and the National & Colorado Federation of Music Clubs.  What does this mean for my child?</p>
  <p>Being an active member of the Guild and the Federation gives me the opportunity to enter my students into "festivals" and/or "auditions".  These events typically are not competitive in nature, but simply provide the student with the opportunity to perform while providing benchmarks for student learning.  In essence, these experiences are meant to benefit the students in a way that motivates them to challenge themselves.  I will make parents aware of the audition dates, but I leave the decision of whether or not to enter a student into these auditions up to the parent(s).</p>
