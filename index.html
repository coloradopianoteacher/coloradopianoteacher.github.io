                                    <p>Julia is a natural, fun, gifted teacher. She met each of my two daughters where they were in terms of skill and learning style, and helped them develop a sense of discipline - always balanced by joy - that extends beyond playing piano. In addition, she's become a caring mentor who truly cares for each of them as individuals. We're so lucky to have found her studio!</p>

I really appreciate her hard work in teaching and correcting my son's techniques and hand position that has had huge progress. She also passed her music passion along to my daughter who enjoys every lesson with her. My two children are fortunate to have Ms Hilton as a wonderful piano teacher. I highly recommend her!!!</p>

My daughter looks forward to every lesson. Julia provides wonderful opportunities for her students to perform in recitals (on a real stage at a grand piano, no less!) and to participate in festivals to compete with other pianists. Due to her fabulous teaching she has many Top Performers from her studio every year, my daughter has been among them. Julia has become family. I'm so thankful to have found such a wonderful woman and teacher to mentor my daughter.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">When should my child start taking piano lessons?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>It depends. I teach children as young as 5 years old. Starting at this young of an age, though, can be frustrating for the student since their biggest challenge will be mastering the hand-eye coordination required to play the piano. Some parents choose to wait until the child is 6 or 7 years old in order to avoid the issue altogether.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Is it possible to schedule a Meet & Greet before committing to our first lesson?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! In fact, children especially seem to really enjoy these since it takes away some of the anxiety that can come along with the first lesson. Meet & Greets last about 20 minutes and allow me to show you the books that I teach from, and share a little bit about myself. I also like to teach students a simple duet on the piano that we will play together before you leave.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I will make every effort to accomodate both your scheduling and transportation needs. My schedule does fill up, however, so the sooner you are able to schedule your lessons, the better.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Typically not. If this is the case with your child, I do prefer that we schedule a Meet & Greet so that I know what I will be teaching from before the first lesson.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I've found that the best technique is to use a practice chart. The chart allows the child to set goals for each week, and provides a sense of accomplishment when he/she meets those goals.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Being an active member of the Guild and the Federation gives me the opportunity to enter my students into "festivals" and/or "auditions". These events typically are not competitive in nature, but simply provide the student with the opportunity to perform while providing benchmarks for student learning. In essence, these experiences are meant to benefit the students in a way that motivates them to challenge themselves. I will make parents aware of the audition dates, but I leave the decision of whether or not to enter a student into these auditions up to the parent(s).</p>
