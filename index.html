I have been studying the piano for 35 years, and have been teaching for 16 years. I currently live in Broomfield, CO where I offer private lessons out of my home.</p>

<p>
I specialize in teaching beginning students to appreciate classical music, but I love to teach advanced students and adults as well. Lessons are individualized and are paced according to each student's individual needs and goals.  I believe that it is important to teach music theory, note reading, technique and performance skills.  I also encourage memorization and creativity, and provide opportunities for recitals and performances as often as possible.</p>
