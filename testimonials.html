  "Julia is a natural, fun, gifted teacher. She met each of my two daughters where they were in terms of skill and learning style, and helped them develop a sense of discipline - always balanced by joy - that extends beyond playing piano. In addition, she's become a caring mentor who truly cares for each of them as individuals. We're so lucky to have found her studio!"

  "Ms. Hilton is an outstanding and inspiring piano teacher.  Her knowledge, enthusiasm and dedication set high standards for her students.  I really appreciate her hard work in teaching and correcting my son's techniques and hand position that has had huge progress.  She also passed her music passion along to my daughter who enjoys every lesson with her.  My two children are fortunate to have Ms Hilton as a wonderful piano teacher. I highly recommend her!!!"

  "My daughter has been taking lessons with our beloved Miss Julia for seven years, since she was just 4 years old. Julia is loving, patient, kind and FUN! My daughter looks forward to every lesson. Julia provides wonderful opportunities for her students to perform in recitals (on a real stage at a grand piano, no less!) and to participate in festivals to compete with other pianists. Due to her fabulous teaching she has many Top Performers from her studio every year, my daughter has been among them. Julia has become family. I'm so thankful to have found such a wonderful woman and teacher to mentor my daughter."
